# Quantization And Equalization Project

This repository contains code for various image processing techniques, including loading grayscale and RGB image representations, displaying figures and images, transforming RGB color images back and forth from the YIQ color space, performing intensity transformations using histogram equalization, and performing optimal quantization.

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3.x

numpy==1.23.4

matplotlib==3.6.1

imageio==2.22.2
